# Regression--Battery-Life-Prediction
This project uses a regression algorithm to predict the battery life of Li-Ion batteries using the NASA Batteries PCoE dataset

---
## Dataset
Batteries
Experiments on Li-Ion batteries. Charging and discharging at different temperatures. Records the impedance as the damage criterion. The data set was provided by the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE).
